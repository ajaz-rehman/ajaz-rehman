# Hi, I'm Ajaz

- üñ•Ô∏è I've been coding in JavaScript and TypeScript, primarily for over 5 years.
- üèóÔ∏è I'm the founder of [Clearalist](https://clearalist.com) and [AutomateMyApp](https://automatemyapp.com).
- ü¶Ä I enjoy building SaaS services and working on greenfield projects.
- üê¶ I'm seeking a back-end or full-stack role, ideally writing JavaScript or Python.
- üé§ I'd love to work at a startup on a tight-knit team where I can quickly make an impact.

## About Me

Full-stack developer with a passion for building innovative SaaS products and a knack for tackling greenfield projects. With over 5 years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, and AWS, I've worn many hats ‚Äì from crafting sleek front-end interfaces to architecting robust back-end systems.

My journey in tech has been an exciting ride. I've had the privilege of working with cutting-edge companies like Adsum, where I developed AI-powered tax solutions, and SKOOT, where I contributed to eco-friendly tech initiatives. But what gets my coding fingers twitching is the thrill of building something from scratch. That's why I've founded two SaaS products of my own ‚Äì each solving unique challenges in the digital space.

I'm also learning Python and finding it incredibly exciting. This new skill is opening up even more possibilities for me to explore and innovate in the tech world.

When I'm not deep in code, you might find me exploring virtual worlds in video games, bringing ideas to life through 3D modeling, or hiking trails to recharge my creative batteries. I'm a firm believer that diverse experiences fuel innovation, and I'm always on the lookout for the next big challenge.

Let's connect and chat about how we can create something amazing together!
