## About Me

Full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building innovative SaaS products and tackling greenfield projects. I'm passionate about solving complex problems with technology, from designing sleek front-end interfaces to architecting scalable back-end systems.

I've contributed to cutting-edge companies like Adsum, where I developed AI-powered tax solutions, and SKOOT, where I worked on eco-friendly tech initiatives.
